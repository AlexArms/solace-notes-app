## About

This is a notes app with Nextjs, Typescript, MUI + styled components, Nextjs API, and MongoDB w/mongoose as the core tech. I started it with Tailwind as I wanted to learn to use it, but wasn't a big fan of it. There is also an express server I created prior to swapping over to using Nextjs's server API. You can find that [here](https://github.com/AlexArms/old-solace-notes-app-server).

## Public Deployment

You can find this app deployed on Vercel [here](https://solace-notes-app-n5le.vercel.app/).

## Running Locally

1. Clone the repo
2. cd into the folder
3. Run npm install
4. Ensure you have mongodb running locally
5. Change .env.local.example to .env.local - it already has the mongo env variable configured for local development
6. npm run dev
7. Open localhost:3000 in your browser
